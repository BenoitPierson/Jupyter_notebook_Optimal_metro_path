* OBJECTIVE : 
	- Find the "shortest" (definition of what we consider to be the "shortest" given below) path between two stations of the RATP metro stations.
	  We call "shortest" path between two stations the path for which the number of stations we pass through is minimum, this is not the shortest in terms of "time"  

* HOW : 
	- Dijkstra algorithm applied to the metro network reshaped as a graph

* WITH : 
	- Metro lines plan

* ASSUMPTIONS :
	- We do not consider real-time traffic information
	- We consider the Paris metro RATP network of 2020 
	- Without any information regarding times between 2 stations, we have fixed a unique inter-station time
	- Without any information regarding times for transfer in a station, we won't consider any time during change at a station
	  --> This lead to optimal paths containing a lot of changes because there are not penalized 
	      and because they sometimes lead to a shortest number of transit stations

* REMARKS :
	- Because of the assumptions, the "optimal path" obtained with this algorithm may differ to the path given by others applications
	- An improvement would be to consider a fixed time for changes, this would lead to easier paths (without many changes)
